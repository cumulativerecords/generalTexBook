%Index next.
%The code below was selected from the documentation for
\usepackage{index}
%See full file in notes directory.
%It was written by an official biblatex package maintainer, as far as I know.
% Starts below. Drawback is that it does not work with \makeindex[intoc] command due to customizations. Will have to look into that. 
%
% We want three indexes: a general index, an index of names, and an
% index of titles. They are defined by way of \newindex, see the
% documentation of the 'index' package for details.
\newindex{default}{idx}{ind}{Subject Index}
\newindex{names}{ndx}{nnd}{Name Index}
\newindex{titles}{tdx}{tnd}{Title Index}
%
% We need to redefine some index formatting directives such that
% biblatex adds names and titles to separate indexes. All names
% should go to the name index, hence we simply redefine the default
% index formatting directive for names. The default definition,
% which is found in biblatex.def, looks like this:
%
%   \DeclareIndexNameFormat{default}{%
%     \usebibmacro{index:name}{\index}{#1}{#3}{#5}{#7}%
%   }
%
% As you can see, the data is simply passed on to a 'bibmacro' which
% takes care of the formatting of the name. The definition of the
% bibmacro, which is also found in biblatex.def, is not relevant in
% our example because all we want to do is change or rather extend
% the \index command, which happens to be the first argument of the
% 'index:name' bibmacro.
%
\makeatletter
\@ifpackageloaded{biblatex_legacy}
  {\DeclareIndexNameFormat{default}{%
     \usebibmacro{index:name}{\index[names]}{#1}{#3}{#5}{#7}}}
  {\DeclareIndexNameFormat{default}{%
     \usebibmacro{index:name}{\index[names]}
       {\namepartfamily}
       {\namepartgiven}
       {\namepartprefix}
       {\namepartsuffix}}}
\makeatother
%
% Titles are handled in a similar way. The formatting directive we
% need to modify is 'indextitle'. It's default definition looks like
% this:
%
%   \DeclareIndexFieldFormat{indextitle}{%
%     \usebibmacro{index:title}{\index}{#1}%
%   }
%
% We modify it such that the \index command writes to the index of
% titles:
%
\DeclareIndexFieldFormat{indextitle}{%
  \usebibmacro{index:title}{\index[titles]}{#1}%
}
%
% That's it as far as splitting the index is concerned. Let's have a
% look at some other facilities you may want to customize. By
% default, biblatex will index the author or editor and the title of
% all references. This behavior may be modified as desired. The
% indexing facilities are not hard-coded. All standard styles which
% ship with this package call two 'bibmacros' which handle the
% indexing. These macros are called 'citeindex' and 'bibindex', both
% of which are defined in biblatex.def. The former handles indexing
% in citations, the latter in the bibliography. Their default
% definitions are as follows:
%
%   \newbibmacro*{citeindex}{%
%     \ifciteindex
%       {\indexnames{labelname}%
%	 \indexfield{indextitle}}
%       {}}
%
%   \newbibmacro*{bibindex}{%
%     \ifbibindex
%       {\indexnames{labelname}%
%	 \indexfield{indextitle}}
%       {}}
%
% The 'labelname' field is a copy of the 'author' field, if there is
% an author, or a copy of the 'editor' field otherwise. 'indextitle'
% is the 'indextitle' field, if defined in the bib file, or a copy
% of the 'title' field otherwise.
%
% The mechanism works like this: the \indexnames and \indexfield
% fields tell biblatex which data to add to the index, the indexing
% directives tell it how to index the data.
%
% The default settings should be fine in most cases. As an example,
% we will modify them here such that author, editors, translators,
% and commentators in the bibliography are indexed:
%
\renewbibmacro*{bibindex}{%
  \ifbibindex
    {\indexnames{author}%
     \indexnames{editor}%
     \indexnames{translator}%
     \indexnames{commentator}%
     \indexfield{indextitle}}
    {}}
