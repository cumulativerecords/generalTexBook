%	For Volume 2, main.tex should have \import for each Segment. There should be one file like this for each Segment, calling respective task lists.

% 	For Volume 1, main.tex has one \import call to this file. Each task list item should have its own .tex file. This should be a giant list of every task list item. That keeps the main.tex page cleaner and allows for easier file management. The file structure can be anything/anywhere. Remember the relative paths for definitions... keep those in place.
