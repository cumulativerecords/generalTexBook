\chapter{After Internship}
The technical guide is now complete. If the guide was effective, you should now have enough knowledge and system tools to do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify and reference the rules for providing supervised experience hours
\item Identify and calculate the proper hours for supervising independent fieldwork in applied settings
\item Assess supervisees as practitioners
\item Assess supervisee's Foundational Knowledge of ABA
\item Structure Group Meetings using the Agenda for Group Meetings
\item Use the Fourth Edition Task List™ with your group
\item Apply the Fourth Edition Task List™ to improve, expand, and maintain each supervisee's repertoire
\item Balance individual and group supervision to improve and maintain the supervisee's behavior analytic repertoire
\item Identify homework assignments
\item Choose from a variety of possible presentation delivery modes for supervisees (i.e., calendar, assigned vs. requested topics)
%\item Connect with Trainaba.com for videos that can be played at group supervision for Weekly Behavior Analytic Lessons
\item Incorporate Behavioral Skills Training into group supervision
%Train ABA's goal is to develop a solid program for supervision through hard work and many trials with feedback. Eventually, we hope to deliver a practical supervision approach that serves the behavior analyst community. We hope you join us in making that dream a reality.
