\subsection{Definition}
Conditioned reinforcer - ``A stimulus change that functions as a reinforcer because of prior pairing with one or more other reinforcers; sometimes called secondary or learned reinforcers'' (Cooper et al., 2007, p. 692). 

Conditioned reinforcement â€“ ``the operation, or process, of a response producing a conditioned reinforcer that increases the likelihood that response occurs in the future'' (Cooper et al., 2007, p. 40).
