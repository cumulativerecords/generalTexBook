\subsection{Definition}
The importance of defining behavior in observable and measurable terms:\\
As Baer, Wolf and Risley said in 1968, ``since the behavior of an individual is composed of physical events, its scientific study requires their precise measurement'' (p. 93). In order to be scientific in our study of behavior, we must be very clear about what behavior it is we are actually studying. Therefore, the target behavior must be observable and measurable. Cooper, Heron and Heward (2007) also make the point that one of the most basic tenets of science is replication. In order for other scientists to replicate an experiment or study, the definition of the behavior under investigation and how it was measured must be transparent enough, that future replication is possible.

Technically-sound written definitions of target behaviors:\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cooper, Heron, and Heward, (2007), suggest that a good behavioral definition is \textit{operational}, allowing the practitioner to obtain complete information about a behavior's occurrence/non-occurrence. Operational definitions allow accurate application of the procedures.
\item Cooper, Heron and Heward (2007) also state that good definitions increase the likelihood that an accurate evaluation of the effectiveness of a study or experiment will be conducted.
\end{enumerate}

Two types of target behavior definitions:\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cooper, Heron, and Heward (2007, p. 65) suggest that there are two types of target behavior definitions:
\item Functional (These types of definition label responses as part of the target behavior's response class if they have the same effect upon the environment.)
\item Topographical (These types of definition look at the shape or form of the target behavior.)
\end{enumerate}

How to write behavioral definitions
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cooper, Heron, and Heward (2007) cite Hawkins and Dobes (1977) as giving three characteristics of good written target behavior definitions:
\item Objective (should refer only to observable characteristics of the behavior and environment and shouldn't utilize inferential terms, such as ``feeling angry.'')
\item Clear (the definition should be readable and unambiguous.)
\item Complete (it should outline the boundaries of what is included as an instance of a response and what is not included.)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ask your supervisee to give you examples of behavior that is not observable or measurable.
\item Ask your Supervisees to write target behavioral definitions for the following behaviors:
\item Hand flapping (Answer = Any repetitive, rapid motor movement of the hands in a back and forth motion which lasts at least 1 second) 
\item Vocal Manding (Answer = Any occurrence of requesting access to a preferred item/action/event using a vocalization such as ``cookie please'')
\item Throwing (Answer = picking up an item and throwing it at least a 30 cm distance from the body) 
\item Being angry (Answer = this is not an observable or measurable behavior)
