\subsection{Definition}
Tact â€“ ``An elementary verbal operant evoked by a nonverbal discriminative stimulus and followed by generalized conditioned reinforcement'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 705).
%
\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Dexter walks outside with his mother and sees birds in a tree.  ``Robins,'' he says.  ``You're right. Those are robins,'' Dexter's mom says. ``Robins'' is a tact.
\item Hector is in the store shopping for Valentines Day.  He sees a variety of flowers before noticing the ones he wants to buy.  ``Red roses,'' Hector says quietly to himself. ``Red roses'' in this context is likely a tact. 
\item Chester goes to his friends Superbowl party.  Upon scanning the array of delicious apps and snacks on the counter, he hones in on one that is his favorite.  ``Ooh, buffalo chicken dip,'' he comments.  ``Buffalo chicken dip'' would be likely a tact in this context.
\item Non-example: Dexter is thinking about buying some cookies the next time he goes to the supermarket.  He writes the word ``cookies'' down on his shopping list.

\end{enumerate}
