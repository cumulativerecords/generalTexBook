\subsection{Definition}
Extinction - ``The discontinuing of reinforcement of a previously reinforced behavior; the primary effect is a decrease in the frequency of the behavior until it reaches a pre-reinforced level or ultimately ceases to occur'' (Cooper, Heron \& Heward, 2007, p. 695).

\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Screaming to avoid/escape washing hands
\item Example: A young woman at a group home was observed to scream loudly every time she was instructed to wash her hands. Each time she began screaming, she was allowed to avoid the task for an average of ten minutes or escape the task altogether. A behavioral analyst instructed group home staff to put this behavior on extinction.  After being instructed to wash her hands, group home staff physically guided her to comply even if she began screaming. After a week, screaming decreased to near zero levels.
\item (Non-example) A young woman at a group home was observed to scream loudly every time she was instructed to wash her hands. Each time she began screaming, she was allowed to avoid the task for an average of ten minutes or escape the task altogether. When she engaged in screaming, group home staff would tell her that if she stopped screaming and complied she would be given chips, a preferred food.
\item Extinction of behavior maintained by positive reinforcement: This occurs when behavior to access tangibles, activities, and/or attention is no longer reinforced. 
\item Extinction of behavior maintained by negative reinforcement: This occurs when behavior to avoid/escape an aversive stimulus/event is no longer reinforced. 
\item Extinction of behavior maintained by automatic reinforcement: This occurs when behavior that provides a natural and automatic sensory consequence is no longer reinforced. (e.g., a child is blocked each time he raises both hands above his mid-line to engage in hand-flapping.)

\subsection{Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Provide a hypothetical scenario and have your supervisee determine if an extinction procedure is in place. If so, have your supervisee define which type of extinction.
\item Have your supervisee give you 3 various examples of extinction. 
\item Describe the pros and cons of extinction procedures based on readings assigned.
