\subsection{Definition}
Operant Conditioning - ``The basic process by which operant learning occurs; consequences (stimulus changes immediately following responses) result in an increased (reinforcement) or decreased (punishment) frequency of the same type of behavior under similar motivational and environmental conditions in the future'' (Cooper, Heron \& Heward, 2007, pp. 700-701).
%
\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item   A rat is deprived of food. The rat walks near a specific part of their cage and receives food. As a result, the future probability of the rat walking toward that area of the cage increases.
\item A child hits their sibling when fighting over a toy. The child is sent to timeout. As a result, the future probability of hitting their sister decreases.
%
\end{enumerate}
%
\subsection{Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Have supervisee provide examples of operant conditioning.
\item Have supervisee describe ways of determining if operant conditioning is occurring (detect a reinforcing or punishing effect on behavior).
%
\end{enumerate}
