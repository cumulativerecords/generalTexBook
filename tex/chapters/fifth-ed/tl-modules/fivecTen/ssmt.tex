\subsection{Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ask the supervisee to explain why the percent of homework completed was the correct dimension to measure for this intervention.
\item Ask supervisee to explain the reason the AB graph design cannot be used to demonstrate experimental control but can be used in applied settings to indicate consistent and therapeutic change.
\item Ask supervisee to find missing elements in a line graph you design.
\item Ask the supervisee to operationally define a repetitive behavior of a friend or family member, identify a dimension of that behavior that would accurately represent occurrences of the behavior, and then design a line graph to show results.
\item Give the supervisee a line graph you design and ask supervisee to interpret level, trend, variability, and data path characteristics within and across conditions. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ask supervisee to identify behavioral targets that would be appropriate to graph in a cumulative record
\item Ask supervisee to create a cumulative record graph.
\item Show supervisee various examples of cumulative records and ask supervisee to interpret the data.
\end{enumerate}
