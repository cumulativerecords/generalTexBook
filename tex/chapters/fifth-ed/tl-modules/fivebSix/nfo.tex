\subsection{Definition}
Punishment - ``Occurs when stimulus change immediately follows a response and decreases the future frequency of that type of behavior in similar conditions'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 702).*

Legislation and agency policies limit the use of punishment. Lerman and Vorndran (2002) suggested that punishment may be considered if:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The challenging behavior produces serious physical harm and has to be suppressed quickly
\item Reinforcement based treatments have not reduced the problem behavior to socially acceptable levels or 
\item The reinforcer maintaining the challenging behavior cannot be identified or withheld 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent BACB Labels specific considerations regarding punishment in the ethical guideline 4.08:\\
4.08 Considerations Regarding Punishment Procedures:
\begin{itemize}
\item (a) Behavior analysts recommend reinforcement rather than punishment whenever possible. 
\item (b) If punishment procedures are necessary, behavior analysts always include reinforcement procedures for alternative behavior in the behavior-change program. 
\item (c) Before implementing punishment-based procedures, behavior analysts ensure that appropriate steps  
have been taken to implement reinforcement-based procedures unless the severity or dangerousness of the behavior necessitates immediate use of aversive procedures.
\item (d) Behavior analysts ensure that aversive procedures are accompanied by an increased level of training, supervision, and oversight. Behavior analysts must evaluate the effectiveness of aversive procedures in a timely manner and modify the behavior-change program if it is ineffective. Behavior analysts always include a plan to discontinue the use of aversive procedures when no longer needed. (BACB, 2014, pp.12-13)
\end{itemize}

Ethical Considerations Related to Punishment as outlined by Cooper, Heron, and Heward (2007):
\begin{enumerate}
\item The right to safe and humane treatment
\item Least restrictive alternative
\item Right to effective treatment
\end{enumerate}

Appropriate Use of Punishment as outlined by Cooper, Heron, and Heward (2007):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Conduct a functional assessment
\item Attempt reinforcement based strategies (behavior as above does not reach socially acceptable levels)
\item Conduct punisher assessment
\item Ensure informed consent is given
\item Include reinforcement based strategies with punishment procedures
\item Ensure all staff are trained in the procedure and monitored closely
\item Use punishers of sufficient quality and magnitude
\item Use varied punishers
\item Deliver punisher at the beginning of a behavioral sequence
\item Punish each instance of the behavior Initially
\item Shift to intermittent schedule gradually
\item If delay in punishment use mediation
\item Supplement punishment with complementary interventions
\item Be prepared for negative side effects
\item Collect data, graph and evaluate daily
\item Discontinue procedure if a decrease in behavior is not observed
\end{enumerate}

Footnotes\\
Positive punishment may also be described as a type of aversive control. Negative side effects include: emotional or aggressive reactions, behavioral contrast, escape and avoidance of the punisher, modeling of inappropriate behavior and the overuse associated with negative reinforcement of the person presenting the punisher (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007)

%\subsection{Definition}
Contingency shaped behavior – Behavior that is ``selected and maintained by controlled, temporally close consequences'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 42).  These consequences may either be reinforcing or punishing.

\subsection{Definition}
Unconditioned punisher – ``A stimulus change that decreases the frequency of any behavior that immediately precedes it irrespective of the organism's learning history with the stimulus'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 707).*

\subsection{Footnotes}
*Conditioned punishers are products of the evolutionary development of the species (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007).\\
*Conditioned punishers are also called primary or unlearned punishers (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007).\\

\subsection{Definition}
Conditioned punisher – ``a stimulus that functions as a punisher as the result of being paired with unconditioned or conditioned punishers'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 40).

Conditioned punishment as defined by Hake and Azrin (1965) is a process that ``results when it can be shown (1) there is little or no punishment effect before the stimulus is paired with an unconditioned punisher, but (2) a punishment effect occurs after (3) the stimulus has been paired, or is being paired, with an unconditioned punisher'' (p. 279).  Evidence of conditioned punishment was suggested in early research when a reduction in a response was observed following the process of pairing a stimulus with an electric shock followed by discontinuing the shock and making the stimulus contingent upon a selected response (Hake \& Azrin, 1965).

\subsection{Definition}
Extinction - ``The discontinuing of reinforcement of a previously reinforced behavior; the primary effect is a decrease in the frequency of the behavior until it reaches a pre-reinforced level or ultimately ceases to occur'' (Cooper, Heron \& Heward, 2007, p. 695).
