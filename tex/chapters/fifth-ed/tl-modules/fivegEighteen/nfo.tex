\subsection{Definition}
The three group contingencies as defined by Cooper, Heron, \& Heward (2007):\\
 ``An independent group contingency is an arrangement in which a contingency is presented to all members of a group, but reinforcement is delivered only to those group members who meet the criterion outlined in the contingency'' (Cooper et al., 2007, p. 568).

``An interdependent group contingency is one in which all members of a group must meet the criterion of the contingency (individually and as a group) before any member earns the reward'' (Cooper et al., 2007, p. 569).

``Under a dependent group contingency the reward for the whole group is dependent on the performance of an individual student or small group'' (Cooper et al., 2007, p. 568).

These three contingencies use the principles of reinforcement to change the behavior of a group of individuals. They involve ``a common consequence (usually, but not necessarily, a reward intended to function as reinforcement) contingent on the behavior of one member of the group, the behavior of part of the group, or the behavior of everyone in the group'' (Cooper et al., 2007, p. 567).
