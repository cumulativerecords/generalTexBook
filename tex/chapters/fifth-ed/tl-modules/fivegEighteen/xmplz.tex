\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Independent Group Contingency: Each student was given a math worksheet and received a special sticker if they completed the work without engaging in disruptive behavior. Billy, Johnny, and Sam finished their work quietly and earned stickers, but Danny was disruptive and only finished half his worksheet so he did not earn a sticker.
\item Interdependent Group Contingency: Each student in Mrs. Kelly's class had to complete their math worksheets before they were allowed to go outside for recess. The students who finished first were allowed to help any of the struggling students. Sam was the last one working and Roger came over to help him complete his work. Once Sam was finished the whole class earned recess time.
\item Dependent Group Contingency: At the end of football practice, Mr. Bill told the team that they could stop running wind sprints if Roger caught a long pass from the coach. Roger caught that pass and the team cheered as they went to shower and practice ended.
