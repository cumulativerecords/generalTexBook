\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Richard is trying to generalize skills learned in the special education classroom for one of his students. He went to each teacher to explain how this will help the student in their class and answered any questions they may have about the programs. In addition, he conducted a training on the specific program and offered to consult with each teacher in order to make sure generalization was successful and the repertoire was maintained.
