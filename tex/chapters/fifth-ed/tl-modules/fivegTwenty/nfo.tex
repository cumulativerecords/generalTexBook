\subsection{Definition}
Self-management - ``...behavior that a person emits to influence another behavior'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 577).

Skinner (1953) first outlined the idea of self-management with his theories on self-control. He defined self-control as, ``When a man controls himself, chooses a course of action, thinks out the solution to a problem, or strives towards an increase in self-knowledge, he is behaving. He controls himself precisely as he would control the behavior of anyone else- through the manipulation of variables of which behavior is a function'' (pp. 228-229).

``All self-control- or self-management- tactics can be operationalized in terms of two behaviors: (a) the target behavior a person wants to change (Skinner's controlled response) and (b) the self-management behavior (Skinner's controlling response) emitted to control the target behavior'' (Cooper et al., 2007, p. 577).

Applications include ``helping a person be more effective and efficient in his daily life, replacing bad habits with good ones, accomplishing difficult tasks, and achieving personal goals'' (Cooper et al., 2007, p. 579).
