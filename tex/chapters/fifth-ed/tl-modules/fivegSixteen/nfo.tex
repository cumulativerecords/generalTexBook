\subsection{Definition}
Punishment - ``Occurs when stimulus change immediately follows a response and decreases the future frequency of that type of behavior in similar conditions'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 702).

Positive Punishment: ``A behavior is followed immediately by the presentation of a stimulus that decreases the future frequency of the behavior'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 701).*

Negative Punishment: ``...behavior is followed immediately by the removal of a stimulus (or a decrease in the intensity of the stimulus), that decreases the future frequency of similar responses under similar conditions'' (Cooper Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 700). *

\subsection{Footnotes}
Alternatively, Fox (1982) described positive and negative punishment as Type I punishment (contingent stimulation) and Type II punishment (contingent withdrawal of a stimulus).

An emphasis on the ethical considerations of using punishment should be introduced when punishment is first discussed.
