Stimulus - ``Any physical event, combination of events, or relation among events'' (Catania, 2013, p. 466).  

Stimulus class - ``A group of stimuli that share specified common elements along formal (e.g. size, color), temporal (e.g. antecedent or consequent), and/or functional (e.g., discriminative stimulus) dimensions'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 705).\\

``Any group of stimuli sharing a predetermined set of common elements in one or more of these dimensions'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 27).

\subsection{Definition}
Stimulus equivalence - ``The emergence of accurate responding to untrained and nonreinforced stimulus-stimulus relations following the reinforcement of responses to some stimulus-stimulus relations. A positive demonstration of reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity is necessary to meet the definition of equivalence'' (Cooper, Heron \& Heward, 2007, p. 705).''
