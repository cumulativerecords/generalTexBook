\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Matilda's mother told her that if she gets all of her homework done this week that she will take her out for ice cream on Saturday. It is only Wednesday and Matilda still hasn't finished all of the work. This is a new contingency for Matilda, but when Saturday arrived, all of her homework was done.
\item Felicia has never put a metal fork in the toaster before but her dad told her that she could be electrocuted if she tried to get her bagel out that way. She always gets a wooden spoon to get the bagel out.
\item Non-example: Matilda's mother told her that if she gets all of her homework done this week that she will take her out for ice cream on Saturday. It is only Wednesday and Matilda still hasn't finished all of the work. Her mother brings her to get ice cream every week that she gets her homework done. When Saturday arrived, all of her homework was done.
