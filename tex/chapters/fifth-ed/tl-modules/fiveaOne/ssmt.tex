\subsection{Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ask your supervisee to describe why an understanding of lawfulness of behavior is important when designing treatments for their client.
\item Ask your supervisee to role-play a scenario in which he/she discusses lawfulness of behavior with a caretaker or teacher of a client.
%
\item Provide scenarios for a supervisee describing repetitive problem behaviors that might lead to a conclusion that internal events are controlling variables for behavior. Tell the supervisee to write a mentalistic explanation that might explain the behavior and then identify a radical behaviorist approach to explaining the same response.
\item Present a scenario in which a supervisee is working with parents or staff who insist that their child is hitting them because she is angry or frustrated. Ask the supervisee to role play explaining to care givers that behavior analysts look at anger and frustration a different way.
