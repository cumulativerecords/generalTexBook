\subsection{Definition}
Shaping â€“ ``Using differential reinforcement to produce a series of gradually changing response classes; each response class is a successive approximation toward a terminal behavior.  Members of an existent response class are selected for differential reinforcement because they more closely resemble the terminal behavior'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 704).
