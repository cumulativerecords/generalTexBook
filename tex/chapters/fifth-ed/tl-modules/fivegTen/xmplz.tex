\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A teacher presents a student with a picture of an apple. The teacher then lays out three other picture cards away from the original picture of an apple. One picture card depicts an apple, the second picture card depicts a banana, and the final picture card depicts an orange. The teacher holds up the initial picture card depicting an apple and states, ``match.''  The student takes the picture of an apple and places it on top of the corresponding picture of an apple. The teacher says, ``Great job'' and gives the student a high five.

\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  A learner is taught that spoken word ``apple'' = picture of an apple = written word ``apple'' = picture of an apple. These two relations are directly taught. However, through this explicit training, the learner can derive that the spoken word ``apple'' = written word ``apple.'' In this example, reinforcement should occur for successful matching of the two trained relations.  Once the third relation is derived, the response should be reinforced.
