\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Don has been asked to help deliver a new differential reinforcement program to decrease his student's self-injury. However, he has been short of staffing lately and cannot do this consistently throughout the day. This has caused the program to be run without integrity and the self-injury to remain at the same rates. Rick, the BCBA who designed the program, started observing the classroom to see why the program was not working. After noticing that Don was only delivering the reinforcers intermittently and missing opportunities for reinforcement, Rick decided to retrain Don and ask the principal for extra staff when someone calls out sick. 
\item (Non-example) Roger is implementing a new response cost program to decrease verbal protesting for one of his students. However, even though the program has been run as designed for several weeks, there has been no effect on the verbal protesting of the student. The supervisor collected integrity data and found that the plan had been run as prescribed. The problem is likely related to the procedure itself and not its implementation.
