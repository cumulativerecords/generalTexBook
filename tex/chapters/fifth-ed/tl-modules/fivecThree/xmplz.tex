\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Twelve strangers walk past an elderly man on the street. He greets three of them and ignores the rest. The percent of occurrence of greeting strangers is 25\%.
\begin{itemize}
\item To compute: Divide number of greetings emitted by the man (3) by the total number of opportunities to greet (12) and multiply that product by 100 to yield a percentage (3/12= 0.25 x 100= 25\%).
\end{itemize}
\item (Non-example) Twelve strangers walk by an elderly man. He greets three of them and ignores the rest. The percent of occurrence of greeting strangers is 0.25.
