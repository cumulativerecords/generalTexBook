\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mary has been exhibiting aggression during sessions with her occupational therapist whenever a novel task is presented. The BCBA has come up with a general behavior support plan for all staff working with Mary to decrease these behaviors. The plan involves multiple options that all are relevant to the addressing the function of the aggression. The BCBA sets up a training to discuss and explain the proper implementation of these intervention strategies, and get feedback from other service providers such as the occupational therapist to increase the social validity of the treatment and increase the likelihood of treatment fidelity.
