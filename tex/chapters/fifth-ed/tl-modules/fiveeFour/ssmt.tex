\subsection{Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If a student screams and covers his ears when moderate noises occur in the classroom, what would the supervisee suggest as the simplest environmental arrangement that might be considered for that student?
\item A client throws objects at staff and pounds the wall when they sit and watch the staff's favorite television shows at night in the client's apartment. What might the staff be told to change at night before the analyst designs a program for reinforcing the client's appropriate television behavior or punishing his inappropriate behavior?
\item If an analyst determines that attention is a major positive reinforcer for problem behaviors for a client, what would the supervisee consider to be an important consequence to increase following appropriate behavior?
