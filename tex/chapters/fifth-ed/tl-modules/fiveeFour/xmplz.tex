\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Parents found it difficult to get their daughter ready for the school bus on time. They decided they would try giving her time to shower at night instead of in the morning. They added showering to her regular nighttime routine and the daughter not only got to the school bus on-time but began to go to sleep earlier after the expanded nighttime routine.
\item A student refused to sit in his seat at school. An occupational therapist suggested a gel filled wedge for the student's chair and the student not only remained seated in one class, but chose to use the wedge in all of his classes.
