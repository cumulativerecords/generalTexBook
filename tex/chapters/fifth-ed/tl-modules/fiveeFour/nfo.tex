\subsection{Definition}
``Behavior analysis is a science of studying how we can arrange our environments so they make very likely the behaviors we want to be probably enough, and they make unlikely the behaviors we want to be improbable'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 15). The behavior analyst assesses the nature of the fit between an individual and the environment in which he/she functions using a three-part contingency (antecedent, behavior, consequences) structure of events. In this process, the analyst identifies motivating operations associated with antecedent events and the consequences that maintain problem behaviors or prevent adequate development of adaptive behaviors. This information can be used to identify relatively uncomplicated proactive environmental changes that will improve the functioning of the individual. As a result of the individual's increased access to positive reinforcement, more intrusive behavior interventions may be less necessary.
