\subsection{Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ask the supervisee what the first part of assessment should be regarding specific situations that would require collaboration with medical professionals to rule out any underlying medical issues. Have them give a rationale as to why this is important. 
\item Ask the supervisee to list a few possible medical/biological considerations that should be ruled out when treating a feeding disorder, toileting issue or sleep problem.
\item Provide supervisee with examples such as this one: A student in a school setting is engaging in severe tooth picking and the classroom teacher is calling you for advice on what to do. Then ask the supervisee what the first step of assessment should be to treating this challenging behavior.
