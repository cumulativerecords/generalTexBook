\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If your client's parent reported that aggression only happens when the client is asked to brush their teeth, then you want to ensure that you can observe the client during times they are asked to brush their teeth.
\item An instructor wanted to use the PLACHECK measurement procedure to record his students' involvement in an in-class group assignment.  It would be appropriate to collect these data when students separate into groups and start the assignment.  Recording data during the lecture or a test would not be an appropriate observation period.
