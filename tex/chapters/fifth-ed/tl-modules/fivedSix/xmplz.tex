\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item An experiment designed to analyze different magnitudes of a punishment procedure to determine the least intrusive magnitude of a stimulus to decrease behavior.
\item An experiment designed to analyze the optimal quality of attention necessary to reinforce appropriate behavior 
\end{enumerate}
%
\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item An experiment that compares response blocking with and without redirection. 
\item An experiment that compares differential reinforcement of alternative behavior with and without extinction
\item An experiment that removes one procedure at a time from a treatment package consisting of three procedures (e.g., Token system, response cost and extinction) and compares responding under each condition to responding during implementation of the full treatment package. 
\end{enumerate}
