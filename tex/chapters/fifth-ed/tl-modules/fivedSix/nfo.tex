\subsection{Definition}
Component analysis - ``An experiment designed to identify the active elements of a treatment condition, the relative contributions of different variables in a treatment package, and/or the necessary and sufficient components of an intervention. Component analyses take many forms, but the basic strategy is to compare levels of responding across successive phases in which the intervention is implemented with one or more of the components left out'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 692).
