\subsection{Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ask Supervisee to list some parameters (schedule, immediacy, quality, quantity) of an independent variable that can be manipulated experimentally
\item Have supervisee describe a hypothetical parametric analysis inclusive of the independent variable parameter to be manipulated and the functional relation to be tested 
\item Ask the supervisee how they could use a parametric analysis to test for the optimal level of treatment integrity. Then discuss what parameter they would measure (i.e., schedule, immediacy) and which values they would select to answer this experimental question.  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ask Supervisee to explain why component analysis research is important to clinical practice (e.g. efficiency)
\item Ask the supervisee to either describe a treatment package they use in their fieldwork or practicum that could that could be tested via a component analysis or have them describe a hypothetical treatment package that could be tested via a component analysis 
\item Have supervisee look at the figures in the articles listed below and explain the findings of the analysis by determining the effective components of the intervention package.
\end{enumerate}
