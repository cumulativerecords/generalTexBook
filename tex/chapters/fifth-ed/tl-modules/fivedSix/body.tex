\sectionmark{B-11 Conduct a parametric...}
\subsection{Definition}
Parametric analysis - ``An experiment designed to compare the differential effects of a range of values of the independent variable'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 701).
%
\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item An experiment designed to analyze different magnitudes of a punishment procedure to determine the least intrusive magnitude of a stimulus to decrease behavior.
\item An experiment designed to analyze the optimal quality of attention necessary to reinforce appropriate behavior 
\end{enumerate}
%
\subsection{Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ask Supervisee to list some parameters (schedule, immediacy, quality, quantity) of an independent variable that can be manipulated experimentally
\item Have supervisee describe a hypothetical parametric analysis inclusive of the independent variable parameter to be manipulated and the functional relation to be tested 
\item Ask the supervisee how they could use a parametric analysis to test for the optimal level of treatment integrity. Then discuss what parameter they would measure (i.e., schedule, immediacy) and which values they would select to answer this experimental question.  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Definition}
Component analysis - ``An experiment designed to identify the active elements of a treatment condition, the relative contributions of different variables in a treatment package, and/or the necessary and sufficient components of an intervention. Component analyses take many forms, but the basic strategy is to compare levels of responding across successive phases in which the intervention is implemented with one or more of the components left out'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 692).
%
\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item An experiment that compares response blocking with and without redirection. 
\item An experiment that compares differential reinforcement of alternative behavior with and without extinction
\item An experiment that removes one procedure at a time from a treatment package consisting of three procedures (e.g., Token system, response cost and extinction) and compares responding under each condition to responding during implementation of the full treatment package. 
\end{enumerate}
%
\subsection{Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ask Supervisee to explain why component analysis research is important to clinical practice (e.g. efficiency)
\item Ask the supervisee to either describe a treatment package they use in their fieldwork or practicum that could that could be tested via a component analysis or have them describe a hypothetical treatment package that could be tested via a component analysis 
\item Have supervisee look at the figures in the articles listed below and explain the findings of the analysis by determining the effective components of the intervention package.
