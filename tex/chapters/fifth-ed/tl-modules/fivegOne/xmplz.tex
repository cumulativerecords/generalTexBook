\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mommy Singing
\item A mommy sings a verse from ``The Wheels on the Bus'' nursery rhyme to her baby. The baby giggles immediately following the nursery rhyme being sung. The mommy is more likely to sing this nursery rhyme to her baby in the future, because the baby's giggling serves as a reinforcer.
\end{enumerate}
 
\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item (Positive Reinforcement) A rat is in a cage, which has a food dispenser lever. To access food, the rat pushes the lever and food pellets are dispensed. In the future, after a few hours of food deprivation, the rat is more likely to push the lever to access food. 
\item (Negative Reinforcement) Negative reinforcement has occurred when a stimulus is removed, or decreased in intensity, immediately following a behavior, and this increases the frequency of that behavior in the future (Cooper, Heron \& Heward, 2007).
\item (Negative Reinforcement) A child asks her friend to turn down the music, as it is too loud for her. The music is immediately turned down. The child is more likely to ask for music to be turned down in the future when it is too loud.
\item (Negative Reinforcement) It is raining so you put up your umbrella and immediately reduce the amount that you are getting wet. You are more likely to put up your umbrella in the future when it is raining to avoid getting wet.
