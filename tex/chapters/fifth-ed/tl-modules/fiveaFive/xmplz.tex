\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Tim was evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention to decrease inappropriate comments for a first grade student on his case load. The data indicated that the behavior had decreased across all settings including when the child was home, displaying generalization of the intervention. He also noticed that the intervention was analytic because the data indicated that on days there was a substitute who was not thoroughly trained on the intervention there was a significant increase in rates of inappropriate commenting. Finally, Tim deemed the behavior of inappropriately commenting to be socially significant because it impeded the student from effectively accessing the classroom curriculum. 
\item Students learning the 7 dimensions of ABA often use the acronyms GET-A-CAB or BAT-CAGE to remember them.
