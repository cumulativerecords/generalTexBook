\subsection{Definition}
``Target behaviors are selected for study in applied behavior analysis because of their importance to the people involved. Applied behavior analysts attempt to increase, maintain, and generalize adaptive, desirable behaviors and decrease the occurrence of maladaptive, undesirable behaviors'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 69).

Van Houten (1979) cited in Cooper et al. (2007, p. 69) suggests ``two basic approaches to determining socially valid goals: (a) Assess the performance of people judged to be highly competent, and (b) experimentally manipulate different levels of performance to determine empirically which produces optimal results. Regardless of the method used, specifying treatment goals before intervention begins providing a guideline for continuing or terminating treatment. Further, setting objective, predetermined goals helps to eliminate disagreements or biases among those involved in evaluating a program's effectiveness.''
