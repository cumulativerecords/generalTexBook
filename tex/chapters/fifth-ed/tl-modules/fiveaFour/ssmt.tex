\subsection{Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ask the supervisee to define each of the domains and then state how each influences the other domains. 
\item Throughout the course of supervision, when reading behavior analytic articles have the supervisee describe the implications of the article in terms of its relation to each of the four domains 
\item Require the supervisee to speak in technical dialect but also provide the supervisee with opportunities to practice restating their precise understanding of behavioral concepts in everyday language that can be understood by families and non-behavioral providers while retaining the underlying philosophy of behavior. 
\item Have a discussion with the supervisee about how the four domains are interrelated and why it is important that the domains influence each other and not operate in isolation.  
\end{enumerate}
