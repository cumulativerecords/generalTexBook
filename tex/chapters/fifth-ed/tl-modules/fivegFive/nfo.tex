\subsection{Definition}
Imitation - ``A behavior controlled by any physical movement that serves as a novel model excluding vocal-verbal behavior, has formal similarity with the model, and immediately follows the occurrence of the model (e.g. within seconds of the model presentation).  An imitative behavior is a new behavior emitted following a novel antecedent event (i.e., the model)'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 697).

Model - ``An antecedent stimulus that evokes the imitative behavior'' (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007, p. 413)

Imitation training is a method often used to teach learners new imitation skills.  During imitation training the learner learns to imitate the behavior of the person providing the model (Cooper, Heron, \& Heward, 2007). Reinforcement is typically delivered for imitation of the model. Prompt fading is often used.
