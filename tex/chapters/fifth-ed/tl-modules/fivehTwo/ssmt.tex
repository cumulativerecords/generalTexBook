\subsection{Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Assign a specific behavior as well as a hypothesized function of that behavior. Have supervisee research and identify 3 potential interventions to decrease the target behavior based on the hypothesized function. 
\item Have supervisee explain under what circumstances they would use each intervention.
%
\end{enumerate}
%
\subsection{Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a list of potential target behaviors. Have supervisee rank the behaviors in order of social significance and give rationale for their decisions.
\item Have supervisee present a case study on a client they are familiar with, including the maladaptive behaviors in their repertoire. Have the supervisee choose two behaviors to target for intervention and state why they chose those behaviors.
\end{enumerate}
