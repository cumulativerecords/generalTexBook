\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A researcher-practitioner designed a multiple baseline study for a woman who hit and scratched herself. The researcher's review of the first three days of baseline data showed that occurrences of the behavior were highly variable without an obvious pattern of responding. The researcher concluded that further delay of treatment that might decrease a dangerous behavior was not ethical. The researcher knew that the strength of the results of his research would be threatened if he began treatment before he had a clear pattern in baseline responding, but his responsibility to his client, and those close to her, was his primary concern. He regretted not anticipating this possibility by choosing a research design that could have demonstrated experimental control without depending on highly stable baseline responding.
\item A student's teacher did not want the student to participate in a graduate supervisee's study because the supervisee planned to work with the student during classroom reading instruction. Even though the research study was designed to provide a benefit to the student by increasing sight-word reading, the boy's parent refused to sign permission for his participation. The supervisee realized that social validity was threatened by his original plan and he would have to arrange to work with the student after school or exclude him from the study.
