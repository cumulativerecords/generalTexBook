\subsection{Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ask the supervisee to explain what baseline logic is and why it is important for showing causal (experimentally controlled research) or correlational (change over time) relations between an intervention and an individual's behavior change. 
\item A graduate student supervisee was planning to conduct single subject research using a withdrawal (ABAB) design. The supervisee wanted to test for a causal relation between a gel-filled wedge pillow and the fidgety, out-of-seat behavior of a middle school student in his class. His supervisor warned that removing an effective treatment might have long-lasting results on the student's performance. What design might the supervisee recommend that would show repetitive positive effects of the gel-filled pillow intervention without requiring the supervisee to withdraw a beneficial treatment? Ask the supervisee to demonstrate his decision by drawing a rough line graph showing both designs with the gel-filled pillow as the intervention and explain why one design is a better choice ethically while still meeting practical goals for the supervisee and student.
