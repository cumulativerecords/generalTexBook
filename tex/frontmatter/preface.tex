\noindent {\Huge Preface\par}
This book continues to be a labor of love. It serves as an excuse to incorporate GNU/Linux command line tools into the soul-crushing Microsoft\textregistered{} workflow of many behavioral service providers. 

Anyone is welcome to participate in the development of this book and other projects like it. All of the source code, including the latest PDF version, is publicly available. 

The code is maintained through Cumulative Records Documentation Society (CRDS), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. GitHub, a software development organization, has generously provided CRDS with lifelong sponsorship for projects like this one.

The technology choices for this book were a form of artistic expression. These tools promote community in the century-long development of behavior analytic services as a profession. The act of using these tools was meant to be rebellious, if not subversive, against the way large books are usually developed. The technology  for this book reflected the do-it-yourself spirit of Skinner's hands-on work with operant chambers. It was pure hip-hop with two turntables and a sampler. It was grunge rock singing love songs in an old garage. It was a \$200 single-subject design study at a university where other departments held out for seven figure grants.

The computers used to build this book were a nod to the traditional applied behavior analysis studies, which could be conducted for cheap with a clipboard and some doctoral students. The best example was an old Lenovo ThinkPad X200, purchased second-hand from Craigslist with cash. This was a statement against consumerism. It said no to ``upgrading'' to next-generation CPUs that ran the telemetry nightmare known as Windows 10.

For this statement, the X200 was perfect. It was golden-era hip hop in all its sound sampling glory. The laptop had a battery life of 23 minutes and came pre-installed with Hello Kitty stickers on certain keys. The stickers said things like, ``return,'' ``shift,'' and ``a.'' And yes, all stickers were placed correctly. The X200 ran a free and open source operating systems powered by GNU/Linux and approved by the Free Software Foundation.

This book was proudly typeset using \LaTeX{}, a free and open source software (FOSS). FOSS was chosen as a nod to B.F. Skinner's writings on culture, in which he voiced the difficulties of communicating non-physical technologies to new audiences. Rather than create a book to be released on a bookshelf, this book was designed from publicly available code. The version control notes were public, so anyone could see the process of creating the book. The goal of these tools was to add a layer of physical technology to a book whose subject was a non-physical technology. Hence, it built on Skinner's vision of better communicating the technology of behavior analysis to general audiences.

\LaTeX{} allowed modularization of the book's files. It keeps all the writing separate from the files that generate the formatting. This was a nod to the stories of Skinner's lab. As the legends tell, one could hear the operant chambers clacking from various experiments, happening simultaneously though measured and analyzed as separate phenomena. In this book's modular design, each file held its own content. Any content file could easily be removed, modified, or replaced without any impact on other pages.


The books were assembled and written using Vim, a free and open source command line text editor. It was compiled using custom shell scripts in a Bash terminal. Git and GitHub were used for version control. The decision to use a command line editor was a nod to an operant chamber. One need only peck at the keys to write, assemble, and distribute this book. No mouse, trackpad, eyes, or graphic user interface is involved. An experienced operator could complete the process blindfolded. The author suffers from tendonitis and frequent eyestrain from extensive computer use, so the command line technology is a welcome option.


While the specifics of the technology choices for this book may seem gratuitous, the purpose was to inspire behavior analysis professionals to indulge their curiosity in computer programming. The intended message is, roughly, that even an English major can learn to write code if the project is interesting. Perhaps others from non-programming backgrounds will consider this project as an invitation to download and tinker with code.
