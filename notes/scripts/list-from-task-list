#			
#	usage:		Use every five years, when BACB updates task list.
#
#			Unix script. Use with task list variables.
#			
#			Purpose of this script is to generate a list of each
#			task list item on its own line.
#			
#			Then it's easy to count them and make dirs.
#			Each dir holds the data for a task list item.
#			The module gets called from a main file.
#			
#			Goal is to keep TrainABA Documentation clean.
